abstract: A diode includes a semiconductor region having at least one two-dimensional carrier channel of a first conductivity type, the first conductivity type being one of a n-type and a p-type conductivity, the at least one two-dimensional channel having a net charge; a material of a second conductivity type, the second conductivity type being the other of the n-type and the p-type conductivity, disposed on the semiconductor region, the material of the second conductivity type having a net-charge in a depletion region that is substantially equal to the net-charge of the at least one two-dimensional channel in the semiconductor region when the diode is under reverse bias; an anode material in contact with at least a portion of the at least one two-dimensional channel and at least a portion of the material of the second conductivity type; and a cathode material in contact with the at least one two-dimensional carrier channel.
