abstract: A semiconductor device includes a layered structure forming multiple carrier channels including at least one n-type channel formed in a first layer made of a first material and at least one p-type channel formed in a second layer made of a second material and a set of electrodes for providing and controlling carrier charge in the carrier channels. The first material is different than the second material, and the first and the second materials are selected such that the n-type channel and the p-type channel have comparable switching frequency and current capability.
