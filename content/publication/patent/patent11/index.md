abstract: A semiconductor device includes a semiconductor structure forming a carrier channel, a barrier layer arranged in proximity with the semiconductor structure, and a set of electrodes for providing and controlling carrier charge in the carrier channel. The barrier layer is at least partially doped by impurities having a conductivity type opposite to a conductivity type of the carrier channel. The material of the barrier layer has a bandgap and thermal conductivity larger than a bandgap and thermal conductivity of material in the semiconductor structure.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
