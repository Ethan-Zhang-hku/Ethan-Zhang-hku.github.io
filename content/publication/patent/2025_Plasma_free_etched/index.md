abstract: A semiconductor device includes a layered structure forming multiple carrier channels extending in parallel at different depths of the semiconductor device and a gate electrode having multiple gate fingers of different lengths penetrating the layered structure to reach and control corresponding carrier channels at the different depths. The semiconductor device also includes a carrier electrode having multiple carrier fingers of different lengths penetrating the layered structure to access the corresponding carrier channels. The carrier fingers are interdigitated with the gate fingers.
