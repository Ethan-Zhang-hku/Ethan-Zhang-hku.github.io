abstract: The lack of avalanche capability is a key limitation of current lateral GaN devices. Despite the report of avalanche in vertical GaN-on-GaN devices, the high wafer cost hinders device commercialization. Here we demonstrate a circuit-level avalanche in vertical GaN diodes on low-cost patterned sapphire substrate (PSS), with the avalanche voltage (1.57 kV) and avalanche current density (>2 kA/cm2) both being the highest reported in GaN devices on foreign substrates. The PSS enables a lower dislocation density than conventional sapphire substrate and is employed in high-voltage GaN devices for the first time. The avalanche voltage in the circuit test reaches 98% of the parallel-plane limit, further affirming that near-ideal avalanche breakdown can be realized on GaN devices on foreign substrates. These results show the promise of the GaN-on-PSS platform for low-cost, robust power devices.
