Current research themes and project topics focus on five major areas:  
- (1) wide bandgap semiconductors for power and RF electronics; 
- (2) Power device reliability and robustness, packaging, circuit-level integration, and system-level applications; 
- (3) Machine learning assisted material-device-circuit co-design; 
- (4) WBG and UWBG materials and devices for electronic, photonic, biological and quantum applications; 
- (5) Devices, circuits and systems for extreme environment applications.
