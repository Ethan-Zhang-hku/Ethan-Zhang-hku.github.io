      title: Wide Bandgap Electronics Group
      subtitle: ''
      text: |
        Our group investigates **wide bandgap (WBG)** and **ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG)** materials and devices for next-generation electronic applications.  

        **Research Focus**  
        - Physics, design, simulation, fabrication, characterization, reliability, robustness, packaging, and circuit applications of WBG and UWBG devices.  
        - Emphasis on the fundamental understanding of UWB/UWBG devices, their new applications in power, RF, sensing, and computing applications, as well as the relevant material-device co-design with machine learning.  
        - Full-stack research scope from materials and devices to circuits and algorithms, and the seamless collaborations with the industry.
