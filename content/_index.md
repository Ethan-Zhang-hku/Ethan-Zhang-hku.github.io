      title: Wide Bandgap Electronics Group
      subtitle: ''
      text: |
        Our group investigates **wide bandgap (WBG)** and **ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG)** materials and devices for next-generation electronic applications.  

        **Research Focus**  
        - Physics, design, simulation, and fabrication of WBG/UWBG devices  
        - Characterization, reliability, robustness, packaging, and circuit-level applications  
        - Fundamental understanding of novel WBG/UWBG device physics  

        **Applications**  
        - Power electronics  
        - RF and sensing technologies  
        - Emerging computing paradigms  

        **Approach**  
        We pursue a **full-stack research scope** spanning from materials and devices to circuits and algorithms, with an emphasis on **material‚Äìdevice co-design enhanced by machine learning**.  
        Our work is further strengthened through close collaborations with industry partners.
